CONCLUSION
Developed an accurate and dependable machine learning model capable of predicting the variety of dry beans. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, predictive modelling and performance evaluation aiming to enhance the accuracy in decision making.
LIMITATION
observed lower precision and recall for class "SIRA" when compared to other classes, suggesting this class is slightly harder for the model to identify correctly. Hence it could be the most challenging class for the model to predict accurately.
FUTURE WORK
If feasible gathering additional samples specifically for the "SIRA" class could help the model learn its characteristics better, potentially improving both precision and recall.
Investigate feature interactions or transformations that could highlight unique characteristics of the "SIRA" class to make it more distinguishable.
